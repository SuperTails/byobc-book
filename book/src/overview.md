# Overview

Hello!

This is the lesson plan for **Build Your Own Breadboard Computer (BYOBC)**.

BYOBC is a framework for learning **how computer systems work**,
by building one from individual components.

By the end of the course, students should understand:
- The fetch/decode/execute loop
- Address and data buses
- Timing constraints
- Memory mapped I/O
- Interrupts
- Using GPIO to interface with peripherals
- Serial communication with UART
- Basic 6502 assembly programming

Though the 80 minute per week format does not have time for it,
the class naturally could be extended to other topics like:
- PCB design
- Modern microcontroller design
- $TODO$

## Course Design Choices

why did i use the 6502?
why breadboards?

## Can I teach BYOBC?

## Core Goals

BYOBC is centered around two guiding principles:
**accessibility** and **justification**.
