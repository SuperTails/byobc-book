## Assignment

Like last time, this chapter will involve writing a program.
`starter-code/checksum.S` contains a program that should compute a "checksum" for data.
A checksum is a small amount of data typically bundled with a larger block of data
used to check for errors in the larger block.

After running the program, it should eventually reach `pass`, and you're done!
If the program reaches `fail`, then something isn't quite right.
